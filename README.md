Quizzes may have multiple choice or free-form answers.

The questions may be formatted in Markdown to allow code snippets.

Student Portal

When a student logs in they should be able to view their old quizzes and see their past scores and progess, using graphics that help them understand the data.
Quiz Taking

If a quiz has been assigned for that day, a student can go directly to it by visiting /quiz. If a quiz hasn't been assigned for that day, /quiz should say so.
The Signup Process

When an instructor creates a new class through the Quiz app, each student should receive an email with a link back to the app for them to either sign up or login. (If they've already taken a class at GA, they should be able to log in with the same account).
